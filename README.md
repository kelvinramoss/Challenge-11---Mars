# Challenge-11---Mars

## Part 1 - Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

1.  Visit the Mars news site

2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.

3. Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles, store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview. Store all the dictionaries in a Python list.

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

1.  Visit the Mars Temperature Data Site to scrape the data.

2. Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column.

4. Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

    - How many months exist on Mars?
            
    - How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?

    - What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? 

    - Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? 

    - About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
